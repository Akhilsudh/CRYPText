CRYPText is a tool that helps in encrypting content (Text/Image) and generate a self sufficient file that is capable of decrytping it with a previously specified password and also capable of encrypting new content into another file.
CRYPText uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard"> AES(Advanced Encryption Standard)</a>. It is a symmetric key algorithm meaning that it uses the same password to decrypt a previously encryted file. This is achieved using <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/crypto-js/">CryptoJS</a>.
